# hello-world
A practice repository as I learn to use GitHub. 

I'm currently taking several programming classes and I am trying to sort out where I fit in on the "tech" scene. 
I know I need to show the coding I do and how I've improved / changed over time. So I'm going to start working in GitHub.
